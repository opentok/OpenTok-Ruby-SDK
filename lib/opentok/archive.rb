module OpenTok
    # Represents an archive of an OpenTok session.
    #
    # @attr [int] created_at
    #   The time at which the archive was created, in milliseconds since the UNIX epoch.
    #
    # @attr [string] duration
    #   The duration of the archive, in milliseconds.
    #
    # @attr [string] id
    #   The archive ID.
    #
    # @attr [string] name
    #   The name of the archive. If no name was provided when the archive was created, this is set
    #   to null.
    #
    # @attr [true, false] has_audio
    #   Whether the archive has an audio track (true) or not (false).
    #
    # @attr [true, false] has_video
    #   Whether the archive has a video track (true) or not (false).
    #
    # @attr [String] output_mode
    #   Whether all streams in the archive are recorded to a single file (<code>:composed</code>)
    #   or to individual files (<code>:individual</code>).
    #
    # @attr [string] partner_id
    #   The API key associated with the archive.
    #
    # @attr [string] reason
    #   For archives with the status "stopped" or "failed", this string describes the
    #   reason the archive stopped (such as "maximum duration exceeded") or failed.
    #
    # @attr [string] session_id
    #   The session ID of the OpenTok session associated with this archive.
    #
    # @attr [float] size
    #   The size of the MP4 file. For archives that have not been generated, this value is set to 0.
    #
    # @attr [string] status
    #   The status of the archive, which can be one of the following:
    #
    #   * "available" -- The archive is available for download from the OpenTok cloud.
    #   * "expired" -- The archive is no longer available for download from the OpenTok cloud.
    #   * "failed" -- The archive recording failed.
    #   * "paused" -- The archive is in progress and no clients are publishing streams to the
    #     session. When an archive is in progress and any client publishes a stream, the status is
    #     "started". When an archive is paused, nothing is recorded. When a client starts publishing
    #     a stream, the recording starts (or resumes). If all clients disconnect from a session that
    #     is being archived, the status changes to "paused", and after 60 seconds the archive
    #     recording stops (and the status changes to "stopped").
    #   * "started" -- The archive started and is in the process of being recorded.
    #   * "stopped" -- The archive stopped recording.
    #   * "uploaded" -- The archive is available for download from the the upload target
    #     Amazon S3 bucket or Windows Azure container you set at the OpenTok dashboard
    #     (https://dashboard.tokbox.com).
    #
    # @attr [string] url
    #   The download URL of the available MP4 file. This is only set for an archive with the status set to
    #   "available"; for other archives, (including archives with the status "uploaded") this property is
    #   set to null. The download URL is obfuscated, and the file is only available from the URL for
    #   10 minutes. To generate a new URL, call the Archive.listArchives() or OpenTok.getArchive() method.
