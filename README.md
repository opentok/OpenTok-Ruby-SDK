# OpenTok Ruby SDK

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/opentok/OpenTok-Ruby-SDK.png)](https://travis-ci.org/opentok/OpenTok-Ruby-SDK)

The OpenTok Ruby SDK lets you generate
[sessions](http://www.tokbox.com/opentok/tutorials/create-session/) and
[tokens](http://www.tokbox.com/opentok/tutorials/create-token/) for
[OpenTok](http://www.tokbox.com/) applications, and
[archive](https://tokbox.com/opentok/tutorials/archiving) OpenTok sessions.

# Installation

## Bundler (recommended):

Bundler helps manage dependencies for Ruby projects. Find more info here: <http://bundler.io>

Add this gem to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "opentok", "~> 2.4"
```

Allow bundler to install the change.

```
$ bundle install
```

## RubyGems:

```
$ gem install opentok -v 2.4.0
```

# Usage

## Initializing

Load the gem at the top of any file where it will be used. Then initialize an `OpenTok::OpenTok`
object with your OpenTok API key and API secret.

```ruby
require "opentok"

opentok = OpenTok::OpenTok.new api_key, api_secret
```

## Creating Sessions

To create an OpenTok Session, use the `OpenTok#create_session(properties)` method. The
`properties` parameter is an optional Hash used to specify whether you are creating a session that
uses the OpenTok Media Server and specifying a location hint. The `session_id` method of the
returned `OpenTok::Session` instance is useful to get a sessionId that can be saved to a persistent
store (e.g. database).

```ruby
# Create a session that will attempt to transmit streams directly between clients.
# If clients cannot connect, the session uses the OpenTok TURN server:
session = opentok.create_session

# A session that will use the OpenTok Media Server:
session = opentok.create_session :media_mode => :routed

# A session with a location hint:
session = opentok.create_session :location => '12.34.56.78'

# A session with automatic archiving (must use the routed media mode):
session = opentok.create_session :archive_mode => :always, :media_mode => :routed

# Store this sessionId in the database for later use:
session_id = session.session_id
```

## Generating Tokens

Once a Session is created, you can start generating Tokens for clients to use when connecting to it.
You can generate a token either by calling the `opentok.generate_token(session_id, options)` method,
or by calling the `Session#generate_token(options)` method on the instance after creating it. The
`options` parameter is an optional Hash used to set the role, expire time, and connection data of
the Token.

```ruby
# Generate a Token from just a session_id (fetched from a database)
token = opentok.generate_token session_id

# Generate a Token by calling the method on the Session (returned from createSession)
token = session.generate_token

# Set some options in a token
token = session.generate_token({
    :role        => :moderator,
    :expire_time => Time.now.to_i+(7 * 24 * 60 * 60), # in one week
    :data        => 'name=Johnny'
});
```

## Working with Archives

You can start the recording of an OpenTok Session using the `opentok.archives.create(session_id,
options)` method. This will return an `OpenTok::Archive` instance. The parameter `options` is an
optional Hash used to set the `has_audio`, `has_video`, and `name` options. Note that you can
only start an Archive on a Session that has clients connected.

```ruby
# Create an Archive
archive = opentok.archives.create session_id

# Create a named Archive
archive = opentok.archives.create session_id :name => "Important Presentation"

# Create an audio-only Archive
archive = opentok.archives.create session_id :has_video => false

# Store this archive_id in the database for later use
archive_id = archive.id
```

Setting the `:output_mode` option to `:individual` setting causes each stream in the archive
to be recorded to its own individual file:

```ruby
archive = opentok.archives.create session_id :output_mode => :individual
```

The `:output_mode => :composed` setting (the default) causes all streams in the archive to be
recorded to a single (composed) file.

You can stop the recording of a started Archive using the `opentok.archives.stop_by_id(archive_id)`
method. You can also do this using the `Archive#stop()` method.

```ruby
# Stop an Archive from an archive_id (fetched from database)
opentok.archives.stop_by_id archive_id

# Stop an Archive from an instance (returned from opentok.archives.create)
archive.stop
```

To get an `OpenTok::Archive` instance (and all the information about it) from an `archive_id`, use
the `opentok.archives.find(archive_id)` method.

```ruby
archive = opentok.archives.find archive_id
```

To delete an Archive, you can call the `opentok.archives.delete_by_id(archive_id)` method or the
`delete` method of an `OpenTok::Archive` instance.

```ruby
# Delete an Archive from an archive_id (fetched from database)
opentok.archives.delete_by_id archive_id

# Delete an Archive from an Archive instance (returned from archives.create, archives.find)
archive.delete
```

You can also get a list of all the Archives you've created (up to 1000) with your API Key. This is
done using the `opentok.archives.all(options)` method. The parameter `options` is an optional Hash
used to specify an `:offset` and `:count` to help you paginate through the results. This will return
an instance of the `OpenTok::ArchiveList` class.

```ruby
archive_list = opentok.archives.all

# Get an specific Archive from the list
archive_list[i]

# Get the total number of Archives for this API Key
$total = archive_list.total
```

Note that you can also create an automatically archived session, by passing in `:always`
as the `:archive_mode` property of the `options` parameter passed into the
`OpenTok#create_session()` method (see "Creating Sessions," above).

# Documentation

Reference documentation is available at <http://www.tokbox.com//opentok/libraries/server/ruby/reference/index.html>.

# Requirements

You need an OpenTok API key and API secret, which you can obtain at <https://dashboard.tokbox.com>.

The OpenTok Ruby SDK requires Ruby 1.9.3 or greater.

# Release Notes

See the [Releases](https://github.com/opentok/opentok-ruby-sdk/releases) page for details
about each release.

## Important changes since v2.2.0

**Changes in v2.2.2:**

The default setting for the `create_session()` method is to create a session with the media mode set
to relayed. In previous versions of the SDK, the default setting was to use the OpenTok Media Router
(media mode set to routed). In a relayed session, clients will attempt to send streams directly
between each other (peer-to-peer); if clients cannot connect due to firewall restrictions, the
session uses the OpenTok TURN server to relay audio-video streams.

**Changes in v2.2.0:**

This version of the SDK includes support for working with OpenTok archives.

Note also that the `options` parameter of the `OpenTok.create_session()` method has a `media_mode`
property instead of a `p2p` property.

See the reference documentation
<http://www.tokbox.com/opentok/libraries/server/ruby/reference/index.html> and in the
docs directory of the SDK.
