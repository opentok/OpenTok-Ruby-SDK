# Release v2.4.0.beta.1

This update includes support for the `initial_layout_class_list` feature of tokens.

# Release v2.3.4

# Release v2.3.3

This release adds an internal option on the OpenTok initializer used to customize the User Agent string. ([#108](https://github.com/opentok/OpenTok-Ruby-SDK/pull/108))

# Release v2.3.2

This release fixes an issue where connection timeouts are too aggressive. It doubles the time allowed while also only counting the time it takes for TCP connect to finish, not the entire HTTP response to be received ([#106](https://github.com/opentok/OpenTok-Ruby-SDK/pull/106) thanks [@dramalho](https://github.com/dramalho))

# Release v2.3.0

New archiving features:
-  Automatically archived sessions -- See the `:archive_mode` option of the `OpenTok#create_session()` method.
-  Audio-only or video-only archives -- See the `:has_audio` and `:has_video` parameters of the `OpenTok#archives.create()` method.
-  Individual archiving -- See the `:output_mode` parameter of the `OpenTok#archives.create()` method.
-  Paused archives -- When no clients are publishing to a session being archived, its status changes to "paused". See `Archive#status`.

Other improvements:
-  Adds default HTTP timeout for requests ([#78](https://github.com/opentok/OpenTok-Ruby-SDK/pull/78) thanks [@dramalho](https://github.com/dramalho))
-  Fixes Archiving sample app ([#96](https://github.com/opentok/OpenTok-Ruby-SDK/pull/96) thanks [@matsubo](https://github.com/matsubo))

# Release v2.2.4

-  Uses updated REST API for `archives.create` and `archives.stop_by_id` [#49](https://github.com/opentok/OpenTok-Ruby-SDK/issues/49) [#88](https://github.com/opentok/OpenTok-Ruby-SDK/issues/88)
-  Adds `rake console` task for gem authors [#91](https://github.com/opentok/OpenTok-Ruby-SDK/pull/91)

# Release v2.2.3

This version fixes a bug related to users on Windows receiving an `OpenTokAuthenticationError` exception because of a bug in an older version of the `httparty` gem. See [#60](https://github.com/opentok/OpenTok-Ruby-SDK/issues/60)

# Release v2.2.2

The default setting for the `create_session()` method is to create a session with the media mode set
to relayed. In previous versions of the SDK, the default setting was to use the OpenTok Media Router
(media mode set to routed). In a relayed session, clients will attempt to send streams directly
between each other (peer-to-peer); if clients cannot connect due to firewall restrictions, the
session uses the OpenTok TURN server to relay audio-video streams.

# Release v2.2.0

This version of the SDK includes support for working with OpenTok 2.0 archives. (This API does not
work with OpenTok 1.0 archives.)

Note also that the `options` parameter of the `OpenTok.create_session()` method has a `media_mode`
property instead of a `p2p` property.

# v0.1.3

Fixes issues:

- [#48](https://github.com/opentok/OpenTok-Ruby-SDK/issues/48) - OpenTokException given invalid number or parameters
